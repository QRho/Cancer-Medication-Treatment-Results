# Observations 
1.) Ramicane seems to be the second most promising cancer treatment second to capomulin. 
2.) The Tumor volume seems to be relative to the weight of the mouse. The weight of the mouse is porportionate to the Volume of the Tumor. Meaning as the mouse increases in size or if the mouse is already a certain size the Tumor will also be of a volume in proportion to that weight.Â¶ 
3.) Each mouse was treated with chosen medication a total of (10) times

This shows summary of stastics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM of tumor volumne for each regimen.
This expoloration of data uses Bar Plots, Pie charts, box plots, line and scatter plots as well as correlation and coefficient and linear regression model 
for mouse weight and average tumor volume for capomulin regimen.
